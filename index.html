            <div> This paper studies how firm–worker agreements to underreport wages affect tax policy design.
            In most tax systems, firms act as third-party reporters to limit evasion, but this mechanism
            weakens when part of compensation is paid off the books—a practice referred to here as
            payments under the table (PUT).
      
            I develop a model of optimal income taxation in an economy where firms and workers may engage
            in PUT and a corporate tax is also in place. The model shows that when PUT are prevalent, the
            corporate tax modifies the classic optimal income tax formula through two channels: a positive
            fiscal externality, since PUT are not deductible from firms’ taxable profits, and a reduction
            in the elasticity of taxable income (ETI), as higher corporate taxation discourages firms from
            paying under the table and narrows the scope for workers to evade. Using administrative and
            survey data from Peru—linked through optimal transport—I find that PUT are widespread and more
            common among higher-income workers. Exploiting a staggered tax reform, I further show that the
            ETI declines when the corporate tax rate increases, consistent with the model’s theoretical
            predictions.

          <h3>Taxation of Couples: Payroll Tax and Transferable Benefits

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <div>This paper examines the optimal design of payroll taxes and social insurance in settings where
                benefits are partially transferable across spouses. In many developing countries, one spouse can
                work informally while accessing coverage through their partner’s formal job, creating household-
                level distortions in labor supply. I develop a model in which couples choose formality jointly, and
                the government sets both a payroll tax rate and a benefit transferability parameter to maximize
                welfare. The optimal policy depends on three elasticities: the responsiveness of male and female
                informality to the net-of-tax rate, and a cross-spousal elasticity capturing behavioral spillovers.
                To estimate these, I exploit Chile’s Bono al Trabajo de la Mujer (BTM), a subsidy that reduced
                the eﬀective payroll tax for low-income women. Using household survey data, I find that women
                eligible for the subsidy reduced informality substantially, especially those married to informal men,
                while their spouses became more likely to work informally. These results suggest that both payroll
                tax rates and benefit transferability should be set below current levels, and that ignoring household
                interactions may lead to ineﬃcient tax and subsidy designs.</div>

          <h3>From Formality to Reality: Reassessing VAT Equity in Dual Economies

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <div>We study the incidence of the value-added tax (VAT) in settings with high informality.
While often viewed as regressive, recent literature suggests consumption taxes may be
progressive under the crucial assumptions of zero pass-through in informal markets and
that low-income households shop predominantly in that sector. We provide product-level
evidence on this pass-through assumption by exploiting a temporary VAT exemption
in Peru. Using high-frequency price data from formal and informal vendors for food
products and a Synthetic Differences-in-Differences strategy, we estimate pass-through of
taxes to consumer prices by product and sector. Household survey data confirms that the
bottom decile of the income distribution spends 34 percentage points more of their budget
in informal markets than the top decile. Our pass-through estimates reveal significant
heterogeneity: we find rates of 80-100% in formal markets, but a product-dependent 0-50%
in informal markets. These varied rates can be rationalized by a theoretical framework
of commodity taxation with endogenous producer prices and heterogeneous household
preferences for sectoral amenities. When we combine our empirical findings on shopping
behavior and product-level pass-through, the progressivity result disappears, indicating
that the VAT remains a regressive instrument in this setting.</div>

            <div> This project extends the work of Feinmann et al (2023) to document payments under the table for formal employees in other Latin American countries. At the moment, we included Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. We find a simple average of 15% of employees who admit to receiving PUTs for about 23% of their wages. This average masks significant heterogeneity, where Argentina has more than a quarter of formal employees receiving PUTs, while this number is less than 4% in Chile. Importantly, PUTs are sharply increasing in wages, with employees in the top wage group doubling the underreporting sharing of low-wage employees. This patterns holds for both the extensive and intensive margin, and for five out of the six countries surveyed. Despite the fact that wages and firm size are positively correlated, PUTs are strongly decreasing on firm size, measured by number of employees. However, a considerable share of employees in firms with more than 500 employees admits to receiving PUTs. Consistent across all countries, employees holding managerial positions and with frequent interaction with owners are significantly more likely to receive PUTs, even after controlling by wages and firm size. We also show that employees with less tax morale are more likely to report receiving PUTs. We provide evidence that cash, bank transfer and virtual payments are the main disbursement methods for PUTs, but with significant heterogeneity across income groups. High-wage employees are more likely to use bank transfers and virtual payments, and less likely to use cash. Finally, we also explore what regulations or taxes help to determine the amount PUT. We find that the minimum wage, social security contributions, payroll taxes, and income taxes ranked at the top. Income taxes and social security contributions are relatively more important for high-wage earners, compared to the minimum wage or extra hours, which are more relevant for low-wage employees. The end of the presentation lists the project's next steps.

            <span class="plink"><a href="https://apfrancoc.github.io/hi/spaniards.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Draft]</a></span>

            <div> This study argues that current heterogeneity in female labour force participation across
elevation levels in Peru may be explained by diﬀerences in historical Spanish influence. Before
conquest, men and women were equally-important in the economic sphere. After conquest,
women became ”legal minors” without enough reasoning power to make economic decisions.
Because of Spanish reluctance to settle at higher elevations, I argue that inclusive pre-conquest
gender roles persist in those areas. Using elevation as an instrument for Spanish influence,
I find that living in a district less exposed to Spanish influence significantly increases fe-
male labour force participation. Results are highly robust to the inclusion of a variety of
demographic, geographical, contemporary and historical covariates.</div>

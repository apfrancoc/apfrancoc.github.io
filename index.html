            <div> This paper studies how firm–worker agreements to underreport wages affect tax policy design.
            In most tax systems, firms act as third-party reporters to limit evasion, but this mechanism
            weakens when part of compensation is paid off the books—a practice referred to here as
            payments under the table (PUT).
      
            I develop a model of optimal income taxation in an economy where firms and workers may engage
            in PUT and a corporate tax is also in place. The model shows that when PUT are prevalent, the
            corporate tax modifies the classic optimal income tax formula through two channels: a positive
            fiscal externality, since PUT are not deductible from firms’ taxable profits, and a reduction
            in the elasticity of taxable income (ETI), as higher corporate taxation discourages firms from
            paying under the table and narrows the scope for workers to evade. Using administrative and
            survey data from Peru—linked through optimal transport—I find that PUT are widespread and more
            common among higher-income workers. Exploiting a staggered tax reform, I further show that the
            ETI declines when the corporate tax rate increases, consistent with the model’s theoretical
            predictions.

          <h3>Taxation of Couples: Payroll Tax and Transferable Benefits
            <span class="plink"><a href="paper2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Draft]</a></span>

            <div>This paper examines the optimal design of payroll taxes and social insurance in settings where
                benefits are partially transferable across spouses. In many developing countries, one spouse can
                work informally while accessing coverage through their partner’s formal job, creating household-
                level distortions in labor supply. I develop a model in which couples choose formality jointly, and
                the government sets both a payroll tax rate and a benefit transferability parameter to maximize
                welfare. The optimal policy depends on three elasticities: the responsiveness of male and female
                informality to the net-of-tax rate, and a cross-spousal elasticity capturing behavioral spillovers.
                To estimate these, I exploit Chile’s Bono al Trabajo de la Mujer (BTM), a subsidy that reduced
                the eﬀective payroll tax for low-income women. Using household survey data, I find that women
                eligible for the subsidy reduced informality substantially, especially those married to informal men,
                while their spouses became more likely to work informally. These results suggest that both payroll
                tax rates and benefit transferability should be set below current levels, and that ignoring household
                interactions may lead to ineﬃcient tax and subsidy designs.</div>

          <h3>From Formality to Reality: Reassessing VAT Equity in Dual Economies
            <span class="plink"><a href="paper3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Draft]</a></span>
          </h3>

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <div>We study the incidence of the value-added tax (VAT) in settings with high informality.
While often viewed as regressive, recent literature suggests consumption taxes may be
progressive under the crucial assumptions of zero pass-through in informal markets and
that low-income households shop predominantly in that sector. We provide product-level
evidence on this pass-through assumption by exploiting a temporary VAT exemption
in Peru. Using high-frequency price data from formal and informal vendors for food
products and a Synthetic Differences-in-Differences strategy, we estimate pass-through of
taxes to consumer prices by product and sector. Household survey data confirms that the
bottom decile of the income distribution spends 34 percentage points more of their budget
in informal markets than the top decile. Our pass-through estimates reveal significant
heterogeneity: we find rates of 80-100% in formal markets, but a product-dependent 0-50%
in informal markets. These varied rates can be rationalized by a theoretical framework
of commodity taxation with endogenous producer prices and heterogeneous household
preferences for sectoral amenities. When we combine our empirical findings on shopping
behavior and product-level pass-through, the progressivity result disappears, indicating
that the VAT remains a regressive instrument in this setting.</div>

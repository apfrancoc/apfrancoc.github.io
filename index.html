        <p>Welcome! I'm a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan.</p>

        <p>My research interests are in public finance, with a focus on optimal taxation.
          I combine theory and econometric methods to design tax policies that address real-world complexities,
          such as tax evasion and large informal economies.</p>

                This paper studies how firm–worker agreements to underreport wages affect tax policy design. In most tax systems, firms act as third-party reporters to limit evasion, but this mechanism weakens when part of compensation is paid off the books—a practice referred to here as payments under the table (PUT).

              I develop a model of optimal income taxation in an economy where firms and workers may engage in PUT and a corporate tax is also in place. The model shows that when PUT are prevalent, the corporate tax modifies the classic optimal income tax formula through two channels: a positive fiscal externality, since PUT are not deductible from firms’ taxable profits, and a reduction in the elasticity of taxable income (ETI), as higher corporate taxation discourages firms from paying under the table and narrows the scope for workers to evade. Using administrative and survey data from Peru—linked through optimal transport—I find that PUT are widespread and more common among higher-income workers. Exploiting a staggered tax reform, I further show that the ETI declines when the corporate tax rate increases, consistent with the model’s theoretical predictions.

              Taxation of Couples: Payroll Tax and Transferable Benefits

                This paper examines the optimal design of payroll taxes and social insurance in settings where
benefits are partially transferable across spouses. In many developing countries, one spouse can
work informally while accessing coverage through their partner’s formal job, creating household-
level distortions in labor supply. I develop a model in which couples choose formality jointly, and
the government sets both a payroll tax rate and a benefit transferability parameter to maximize
welfare. The optimal policy depends on three elasticities: the responsiveness of male and female
informality to the net-of-tax rate, and a cross-spousal elasticity capturing behavioral spillovers.
To estimate these, I exploit Chile’s Bono al Trabajo de la Mujer (BTM), a subsidy that reduced
the eﬀective payroll tax for low-income women. Using household survey data, I find that women
eligible for the subsidy reduced informality substantially, especially those married to informal men,
while their spouses became more likely to work informally. These results suggest that both payroll
tax rates and benefit transferability should be set below current levels, and that ignoring household
interactions may lead to ineﬃcient tax and subsidy designs.
